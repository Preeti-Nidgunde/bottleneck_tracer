Automated Web Server Log Analysis for Performance Bottleneck Detection

This project provides visual insights into web server performance by analyzing access logs. It uses Pandas and Seaborn to process log data, calculate performance metrics, and generate interactive visualizations of slow requests, response time distributions, and hourly trends. The tool empowers developers and operations teams to quickly identify and address performance bottlenecks.
